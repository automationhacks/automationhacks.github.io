What should a budding tester learn in order to grow in their craft and in what sequence?

I sometimes reflect on this question as I introspect on my career. The choices are immense and sometimes it is overwhelming, to say the least. Where should someone new to the profession even start?

In this post, I aim to present to you some **options**. The options that you choose would largely depend on your personal interests as well as the company/organization that you work for.
