Hi there 👋🏻,

I'm Gaurav Singh. I live in India 🇮🇳 with my wife and with my other
love ...

Computers 💻 what else?

I like to think of myself as a Technology enthusiast and a big geek.

My first home PC ran
on a **Intel 80386 CPU with just 80 MB Storage and 1 MB RAM** 🤯 running
[**Windows 3.1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x) and the earliest
programming language I remember fumbling with at school was
[**BASIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) so I guess I grew up around
computers and games right off the bat

## All things testing

Over the years, I have been **Testing** and **Automating** a lot of Web apps,
Mobile Apps (Android/IOS) and Backend systems (API, Distributed systems) in
different domains and companies of different sizes ranging from large
enterprises, mid sized product companies and hyper growth startups

I consider myself a fairly experienced **Tester** but more broadly as a
**generalist Software engineer** (T shaped individual if you say) and have spent a significant amount of time writing
Test automation frameworks, tools and infrastructure with any programming language that makes
sense (I don't differentiate but self admittedly I have a bias towards Python and Kotlin)

My work and experience have made me quite _opinionated_ on how _good testing
should happen_ and I do **NOT** believe a tester is a sole person responsible
for Quality but rather in a whole team testing approach.

## Core values and principles

Below is a short list of some personal principles and values:

- One of my core principles in life is to **Have strong opinions weakly held**
  ,healthy debate and discussion are **very** valuable to me to learn and grow
  together. I believe the best ideas should stand on the shoulder of data and
  experience and in the end should win regardless of who the loudest or senior most voice in the
  room is.
- I also like to follow the
  [**reasonable person principle**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weigand/staff/) and
  am always keen to listen and understand all viewpoints for something under
  discussion before drawing my own conclusions.
- I believe in
  [**Trust, but verify**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankarmstrong/2019/10/21/trust-but-verify/?sh=43ec8e135873)
  and like to give people a lot of upfront benefit of the doubt but believe over
  the long term trust is largely **earned** through **actions and behavior** and
  I do not look at _just_ the surface but try to dive deeper.
- I believe the **best way to learn something is to teach it** and thus I try to
  be active in the Software engineering and Testing community and share as well as learn
  from others. You may find value in going through some of the
  [courses](courses.md) i've created and [talks](talks.md) that i've delivered.

## Why do you blog?

My reasons are **mostly selfish**. I needed a repository of solutions to common
Testing and Test automation problems and also a way to keep track of my journey through the
world of Software engineering.

This blog is a way for me to hold on to all these experiences and sort of leave
a trail of breadcrumbs which I (_or someone else_) could go back and refer.

To me, testing is a **holistic** field in itself with its own set of **nuances**
and this blog is a way for me express and share it with the larger community.

Hopefully, this is useful, relevant or at least interesting to other people as
well.
