The best way to learn is as a community and thus, I _sometimes_ write 🧑‍💻
guest posts or make videos for other popular blogs and platforms.

You can find links to these below and can read the one that interests you
specifically or visit my author profile on these sites (see links) to see all
written posts. 😉

> lot from their experience.
