_My Experience as a first time speaker in a test automation conference and the awesome talks and
tools that I learned about._

![Attendees](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/3b765-1hwecq1pyuqo0z0zgspvpfw.png)

Appium Conf had its 2nd edition in the garden city of india between 13–15 June 2019 and had an
impressive lineup of [speakers](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/speaker) from all across the
world with so many cool things to share with the community. This post is a summary of what sessions
I personally attended and what i learned from them, as well as an inside track into how it felt to
deliver my first ever conference talk.

With that set, Let’s jump right in.

With three parallel tracks set, It was impossible to attend all of them so I selected my schedule
based on the topics or speakers who had a higher calling to me personally. The
[ConfEngine](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/schedule#) app has this sweet web/mobile app to
allow you to see what sessions are playing right now as well as the ones you **want to attend** and
add them as a calendar invite so sniffing through them was pain at all.

Also all of these sessions were being recorded so I am glad that we can go back in time and listen
to the wealth of information in them.

### Day 1

![](https://automationhacksblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/6bdfd-1khzv8h20liqtigyberi2ga.png)

#### [Jonathan Lipps — Appium: The Next Generation](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9574/appium-the-next-generation)

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWXQ_TRYKic) is already out. But apart from the plans to
make appium more pluggable and vision to ensure it keeps up with changes in mobile tech. The best
highlight of this keynote was when Jonathan showed off an Appium driver for raspberry Pi and how he
could use it to play a live drum sequence. Checkout the
[code here](https://github.com/jlipps/appium-raspi-driver).

#### [Angie Jones — Your Tests Lack Vision: Adding Eyes to Your Automation Framework](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9067/your-tests-lack-vision-adding-eyes-to-your-automation-framework)

[Angie Jones](https://medium.com/u/6ddbd027381e) **live demoed** how to use Applitools to add
additional intelligence to the UI tests and how easy it is to control what level of granularity you
want in your verifications. To beat it all off, while the appium test was running she had super cool
beats to listen to.

Also she is an awesome person to hang out and talk to in person. She contributes to the community a
lot as part of her role as Test Advocate and Director of
[Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/) which is a community driven
site to host test automation courses at Applitools

#### [Vishvnath Pratap Singh / Lokesh Mittal — Automated Solution for Non Functional Requirements (NFR) & Performance Metrics Of Mobile App](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9082/automated-solution-for-non-functional-requirements-nfr-performance-metrics-of-mobile-app)

Woah! This was quite a technical talk and the speakers provided a glimpse into how they are using
Espresso/whole suite of other tech to gather perf metrics. Here are the
[slides](https://drive.google.com/a/go-jek.com/file/d/1qEHNgFToydAyNkf7sppCmIQ1_cbDQfS3/view?usp=drive_open)
and this is definitely a video to watch out for.

#### [Gaurav Singh — How to kill test flake in Appium?](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/8698/how-to-kill-test-flake-in-appium)

![](https://automationhacksblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ccf63-1ghiz4ahjc9_m3lzxujjf0q.png)

Well, Had to attend this one since I **was the one giving it**.
![😁](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f601.png) I aimed to
give a set of strategies that engineers can follow to ensure they are able to reduce test flakiness
to a minimum and this was heavily if not all inspired by a series of articles written on
[appium pro](https://appiumpro.com/editions) by Appium Team and other webinars given by Jonathan.
Giving this talk was a really good exercise in public speaking and not only did I learn a lot, I
realized that I could actually talk in front of people and convey an idea. Looking forward to
helping the community out in future talks as well. Here are the
[slides](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/zA1rir4oIv97k6?feature=oembed) in case
you want to check it out.

Oh Oh! Did i mention catching up to Jonathan was a highlight of this conference for me.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### [Daniel Graham — Unlocking New Testing Capabilities with Espresso Driver](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9284/unlocking-new-testing-capabilities-with-espresso-driver)

Great talk by Dan in which he explained how much of espresso’s capabilities can be easily leveraged
in appium and this support is only gonna grow better. His explanation of how espresso works and
examples on Idling resource were really helpful.

#### [Pradeep Soundararajan — Building Tools to Free up Exploratory Testers](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9488/building-tools-to-free-up-exploratory-testers)

Boy is pradeep a gem of a person to talk to. He spoke a lot about the theory behind testing and
shared stories around his years of experience solving pains felt by him as a tester in different
companies. The key takeaway for me was really to not be limited by the problem space but think of
how we can create tools/utilities to make our life as a tester so much easier.

#### Dan Cuellar — [Lightning Talks](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9583/lightning-talks)

The day ended for me with a set of amazing lightning talks which were organized and managed by none
other than Dan Cuellar the creator of appium itself and they were too good. Would be waiting for
this video to come out.

![](https://automationhacksblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a6973-1kexdnsnvs5jmtglv5kngnq.png)

To top off the day. I won a lucky draw to get a vision drone as part of goodies given away by Sauce
Labs. The day couldn’t have ended on a better note:

> Wow. Just won Vision drone as part of Sauce Labs goodies give away. I guess today is my lucky day.

### Day 2

![](https://automationhacksblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/f3f0f-1koi8v7nzgnvuvjleqin2mw.png)

#### Jason Huggins: [Don’t Fear the Robot](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9580/dont-fear-the-robot)

It’s not everyday that you get to hear from the creator to Selenium, Founder of Sauce Labs and
Tapster in person and this was this one of the highlights of this conference for me. He talked about
how his company [Tapster robotics](https://www.tapster.io/) is building robots to perform automation
for different use cases and this was super cool.

Jason also live demoed use of IOS 13 mouse actions with a Appium driver running on arduino to show
off a test on Angry bird app! All live!. That was the second IOT driver during this conference done
in such a short span of time.

> Woah! Using an appium driver on arduino to use IOS 13 mouse actions.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Chatting up with him in person was a dream come true. He is such an accomplished individual and gem
of a person to speak to and hearing a lot of the history of the selenium project from him directly
was incredible.

> Had a fanboy moment meeting and talking to [@hugs](https://twitter.com/hugs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).
> Really interesting conversation!

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### Justin Ison — [Appium Native Application Crawler](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/8262/appium-native-application-crawler)

Justin shared how he build an app crawler to walk through an app and figure out if the app was not
localized properly. To beat that it is all open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/isonic1/Appium-Native-Crawler)

#### [Diego Molina ](https://github.com/diemol)— [Building a Mobile Testing Infrastructure: What I Learned](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9248/building-a-mobile-testing-infrastructure-what-i-learned)

I had listened to an earlier test talks podcast episode in which
[diego spoke about Zalenium](https://www.joecolantonio.com/testtalks/208-selenium-grid-zalenium-diego-molina/)
and he lot of practical tips to share on how to setup and build a mobile infrastructure. Highlight
being the depth in which he discussed the stack and the tools/tech used and the pragmatism of it
all.

Here are some tools he mentioned:

- Puppet, Chef, Ansible (Infra as code)
- QEmu (Linux world), Docker or Virtualbox (VMs)
- Prometheus (App monitoring)

#### [Srinivasan Sekar / Sai Krishna — Native mobile commands in Appium](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/8946/native-mobile-commands-in-appium)

These amazing speakers had practical advice on handing some hard to automate scenarios using
[native mobile commands](http://appium.io/docs/en/commands/mobile-command/)

#### [Jonah Stiennon — All Desired Capabilities](https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/8673/all-desired-capabilities)

Boy this was my favourite talk in all of appium conf. Jonah in a 90 mins talk walked through around
180 appium desired capabilities and even demoed how he goes about finding what each one of them does
all while keeping the talk incredibly funny. He also setup
[caps.cloudgrey.io](https://caps.cloudgrey.io) to host all of these tagged with different levels of
complexity and am sure this would be an awesome community resource going forward.

My exact sentiment with this talk was:

> What an awesome memory Jonah has. Give that man a medal!

And that was a wrap of Appium Conf for me.
