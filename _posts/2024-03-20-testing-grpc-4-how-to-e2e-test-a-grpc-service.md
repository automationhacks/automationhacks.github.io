In the previous blogs in this series, we learned [what gRPC is, using web UI to explore the API](https://newsletter.automationhacks.io/p/testing-grpc-1-set-up-a-grpc-server) and then how to unit [test the server](https://newsletter.automationhacks.io/p/testing-grpc-2-how-to-unit-test-a) and [client code](https://newsletter.automationhacks.io/p/testing-grpc-3-how-to-unit-test-a-grpc-client). Please feel free to catch up on those before reading this one.

## What you’ll learn? 🌱

In this article, I’m gonna walk you through how to write a functional API test for a gRPC API using the live service. It's super important to write these end-to-end tests to make sure your API works the way it's supposed to. We'll start with setting up the codebase and then create a basic test client to talk to the gRPC API.

After that, I’ll show you an example of a functional API end-to-end test using TestNG and how to check if the API is responding properly. Let’s go! ⚡

## Why write E2E tests?

Writing unit tests is probably the fastest way to get quick feedback about your services and codebase health. They are the lowest fidelity and fastest among different types of tests that you can write.

However, would you be confident in shipping a unit-tested API directly to production?

Probably not!

You still would want confidence that the API works functionally.

Let’s assume your API is consumed by an upstream API, in such a case, you would want to make sure your API accepts valid input as per the contract that you’ve agreed with the dependant team and returns expected responses to the upstream service in positive, negative and edge test cases

You can get some of this isolated feedback with an integration test as well, however, if the workflow is complicated and you have multiple dependencies between APIs and databases, then writing integration tests could be tedious at best.

That's where a bunch of E2E tests come pretty handy.

While they run slower than a unit or integration test, in return you get realistic feedback about the state of your API, workflows, etc.

In this post, we’ll build on top of what we’ve learnt so far and explore how we can write functional API tests for a gRPC service.

**Hint ⚡**: It's not so much different 😉

## Set up repo and codebase ⚙️

For this next section of the blog, I’ve copied the relevant files from [grpc-java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples/src/main/java/io/grpc/examples/routeguide) and created a new standalone project in my Github account that only covers **routeguide service**.

This should help make it easier for someone new to not be overwhelmed by the huge project structure and seeing a lot of unrelated complex code.

Repo: [https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc)

We will clone the repository and set up a new project in IntelliJ and ensure the build the successful by running these commands:

Using SSH

```zsh
git@github.com:automationhacks/grasp-grpc.git
```

Using Github CLI

```zsh
gh repo clone automationhacks/grasp-grpc
```

Let’s check we can build the project without running tests for now

```zsh
./gradlew clean build -x test
```

Let’s ensure that we have all the classes generated by building the project

```zsh
./gradlew installDist
```

Let’s start our test server by running below

```zsh
./build/install/grasp-grpc/bin/route-guide-server
```

We can see that our server is running at localhost:8980 port

```zsh
Mar 19, 2024 9:52:42 PM io.automationhacks.routeguide.RouteGuideServer start
INFO: Server started, listening on 8980
```

## Write an API test client

When we test a live API, it is usually hosted at some specific host and port on infrastructure that could be either our company local data center or cloud platforms like Google cloud, AWS, Azure, etc.

We’ll write a test client for our E2E API tests so that we can invoke our gRPC APIs and also maintain this as we add more functions

Below is how we can create a simple client with one method for getFeature() service method

[RouteGuideTestClient.java](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc/blob/main/src/main/java/io/automationhacks/routeguide/RouteGuideTestClient.java)

```java
package io.automationhacks.routeguide;

import io.grpc.ManagedChannel;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannelBuilder;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class RouteGuideTestClient {

 private final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(RouteGuideTestClient.class.getName());
 private final RouteGuideGrpc.RouteGuideBlockingStub blockingStub;

 public RouteGuideTestClient(String host, int port) {
   ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress(host, port).usePlaintext().build();
   blockingStub = RouteGuideGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel);
 }

 public Feature getFeature(Point point) {
   return blockingStub.getFeature(point);
 }
}
```

Let’s unpack this,

We initialize RouteGuideBlockingStub to allow us to make API calls

```java
private final RouteGuideGrpc.RouteGuideBlockingStub blockingStub;
```

Within the constructor, we accept the host and port where the server is running and then use ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress() method to get a ManagedChannel instance

```java
public RouteGuideTestClient(String host, int port) {
   ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress(host, port).usePlaintext().build();
}
```

We then use this channel to initialize our blockingStub

```java
blockingStub = RouteGuideGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel);
```

And then write a method for our **getFeature()** API that accepts a **Point** and then returns the **Feature** at that specific point

```java
public Feature getFeature(Point point) {
   return blockingStub.getFeature(point);
 }
```

While we can go ahead and implement other service methods, this single fine for now and we’ll implement them in the future while understanding other testing concepts

## Writing an API E2E test

Let’s write a functional API test to verify the getFeature() service method is working fine.

Below is the complete test which you can also find in examples/src/test/java/io/grpc/examples/routeguide directory in the codebase

[RouteGuideE2ETest.java](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc/blob/main/src/test/java/io/automationhacks/routeguide/RouteGuideE2ETest.java)

```java
package io.automationhacks.routeguide;

import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertWithMessage;

import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class RouteGuideE2ETest {

 private static final String HOST = "localhost";
 private static final int PORT = 8980;

 @Test
 public void testGetFeature() {
   System.out.println("Executed testGetFeature()");
   RouteGuideTestClient client = new RouteGuideTestClient(HOST, PORT);

   int latitude = 407838351;
   int longitude = -746143763;

   Point point = Point.newBuilder().setLatitude(latitude).setLongitude(longitude).build();
   Feature response = client.getFeature(point);

   assertWithMessage(
           "Could not find the feature at lat: %s long: %s".formatted(latitude, longitude))
       .that(response.getName())
       .isEqualTo("Patriots Path, Mendham, NJ 07945, USA");
 }
}
```

Let’s understand our test

Within our test, we have specified our host and port where our server is running

⚡ In a real framework, it's a good idea to store these in an environment properties file and read it using Java classes to manage system properties. This would ensure if the host/port changes, we only have to change properties file, or build in flexibility to make the test environment agnostic

```java
private static final String HOST = "localhost";
private static final int PORT = 8980;
```

We’ll use TestNG test runner to run our E2E tests and we specify the test method by annotating our function with **@Test**

```java
@Test
 public void testGetFeature() {}
```

To make the API call, we need to initialize the test client that we had earlier created

```java
RouteGuideTestClient client = new RouteGuideTestClient(HOST, PORT);
```

We use the builder provided by protocol buffers to create a point object and set latitude and longitude

```java
int latitude = 407838351;
int longitude = -746143763;

Point point = Point.newBuilder().setLatitude(latitude).setLongitude(longitude).build();
```

We then make the API call via the client like below:

```java
Feature response = client.getFeature(point);
```

Finally, we assert if the response name provided matches our expectation, we use fluent assertions from [Google truth library](https://truth.dev/)

```java
   assertWithMessage(
           "Could not find the feature at lat: %s long: %s".formatted(latitude, longitude))
       .that(response.getName())
       .isEqualTo("Patriots Path, Mendham, NJ 07945, USA");
```

How do we know this latitude/longitude would return this feature name?

When the server starts, we read from a JSON file specified called [route_guide_db.json](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc/blob/3199fb54471aea98468efc7d271fe6efcfb80156/src/main/resources/io/automationhacks/routeguide/route_guide_db.json#L4) and store it in the in-memory collection.

RouteGuideServer.java

```java
public RouteGuideServer(int port) throws IOException {
 this(port, RouteGuideUtil.getDefaultFeaturesFile());
}
```

Let’s run our tests using below command

```zsh
./gradlew clean runTests
```

We can see our test was executed since it printed our logger entry Executed testGetFeature() and our test passed 🎀

```zsh
> Task :runTests
