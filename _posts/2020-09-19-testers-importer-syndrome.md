Hi there, friend 👋,

Have you come across occasions where you feel like you **don't know enough about something** and
that people are going to catch you in your act of ignorance or find out that you are a fake or an
imposter?

If you feel this way sometimes, Turns out that you are not at all alone. This is a very common
phenomenon faced by humans in different industries though more common in tech and is called
[Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

## When does this happen

### As a tester 🕵️‍♂️

As a tester, you are _"supposed"_ to be the product expert right?. You should be knowing the in's
and out's of the system and should be able to explain what everything in the system does instantly
no?

While this is something to strive for, there are a few fundamental flaws with this expectation

- The system is rarely going to be constant and will keep on evolving with every new feature request
  that comes in
- It's quite difficult to keep track of every change that might alter your understanding of the
  system.
- In a team, multiple people might test different parts of the system and thus leading to no one
  person knowing everything
- Unless you are the one who is writing the code, it's difficult to understand each code path that
  can be taken while having to tackle this under the pressure of a release timeline

This can lead to testers sometimes feeling like an imposter 😲 since, in many cases wherein they
might not know everything about the system that they test.

On top of this, there are many aspects of the system to test. Apart from the functionality of the
apps UI, You have to consider the backend systems, Performance, Accessibility, Privacy, Security,
Localization, and whatnot.

It takes probably a lifetime to be proficient in most of these areas and might make you think what
you know is not much

### As an automation engineer

As an automation engineer, aren't you supposed to be the automation expert that can well, magically
**automate anything** 🐇, It seems like almost every few months a new tool/library comes out with
its own set of implementation idiosyncrasies.

This put's even the pressures of dev domain on testers, wherein you are in the race to understand
different programming languages/test tooling and good design pattern to create scalable frameworks
while even understanding the internals of the application you are testing.

Product managers/engineering leads might expect you to have a clear idea of how/by when something
will be tested/automated and how long would it take? This is on top of having to maintain an
existing automation framework/tests/infra

Phew, 😓 so much pressure right? It might feel like an uphill task to be able to catch up with all
of these internal and external expectations at the same time and might be quite natural to feel like
you don't know much.

## What can you do to deal with it

You have to first understand you are a human at the end of the day and while engineers typically
want to think that they are the smartest person in the room, as it turns out in most situations,
that's not the case.

Understanding and being mindful of your current limitations is a good first step towards reducing
some of these expectations

### It's okay to say that you don't know

Don't put the unnecessary pressure of always being the **expert**, instead be open about when you
don't know something about the system or a new tool/framework. Treat these as opportunities to learn
more and explore the system better rather than fixating on the fact that you don't know something

It's always okay to say that **X** is something you are not familiar with, **"at the moment"** but
will learn more about, and then make **goddamn sure** that you follow up.

> Remember: Action speaks much louder than words

Done enough no of times, you are going to start figuring out different pieces of the puzzle, and
understand more about the system that you test or automate or how the automation fits together

Whenever you learn something new, make sure you document these aggressively in either your projects
wiki or your notes, make a mental model of these either in a flow diagram or mind map, whatever
works best for you.

I can't tell you how many times I've had to revisit my notes about a system or feature to recollect
stuff. Having a system like that to support you is very important.

Our brains at the end of the day are not designed to store stuff (unless you have an _eidetic
memory_) but rather to think creatively about problems and thus building a second brain is something
that's very important. Want to know more? Check out

### A team is always 🏃🏃🏃 > 1 person 🏃

You have to realize that there is a reason humans **work better in teams** than **individually**. A
team is a possibility to learn so many different things from others and probably one of the best
leverages you have against imposter syndrome

Talking to others openly about this will make you realize that everyone on the team is proficient in
different skills and no one knows everything. It's a healthy balance of complementing skills that
makes a great team at the end of the day

You have to ensure that there is a healthy ⚕️ culture within the team wherein everyone feels
comfortable in saying **I don't know X** to their leaders/managers and people can voice out their
thoughts/concerns in a safe environment while having the time/space to learn and grow

You should learn to work well with others and delegate/pair on stuff with others if they are better
suited for the job but ensure you learn from them so that you are not bottlenecked on someone else.
This way a team stands on the shoulders of each other and can grow while still ensuring no one
individual feels like a fake

### Learn constantly 🧑‍💻

This is probably one of the best ways of dealing with this problem. If you are maintaining a healthy
learning backlog and have invested in developing good habits on learning new technologies, then over
time you will quite naturally develop expertise in many different areas.

Sometimes you might come across brilliant engineers who seem to know it all and things might appear
to be very natural for them. These people are usually good and confident communicators, This might
lead you to think that you are not good enough, but if you dig deep you might find that they would
have put in the time to reach where they are, and you can too. All it takes is building good habits

### Keep track of what you have done

Sometimes we fixate so much on what we **don't** know, that we easily forget what we **do know**.
Keep track of things that you have achieved/learned. Might not hurt to create a
[brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) to keep track of your awesome work.

Referring to these when you are in a short term bout of self-doubt might give you a boost. However,
remember to not be cocky or rest on your past laurels. Always look to the future while staying and
working in the present. (_Hmmm... This could even be a quote..._ 🤔)

## Conclusion

I'll admit, it is not easy to get rid of this feeling. However, if you take care of some of the
points above, I think it would be much easier for you to work around this. Trust me, You got this.
