TestNG is a popular test framework that needs no introduction in the JVM (Java virtual machine) ecosystem and can be used for automating your tests regardless of their size. For example: Large (functional) or medium/small level tests (Integration/Unit). It is a highly customizable framework and provides great flexibility around how you want to structure your tests and run them.

Once you have some set of tests, the next logical step typically entails figuring out and implementing a **sensible logging** and **reporting** method to allow you to understand your runs and figure out failures.

Though there are multiple frameworks available to implement logging and reporting, I wanted to see what is shipped out of the box. Recently, I posted about this topic on the **[TestProject](https://testproject.io/)** blog.
